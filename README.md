# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
Louise works in theater and produces plays and other theatricals.  It’s our mission to provide Louise enough data to support her goal of campaigning for and producing successful theatrical pursuits and plays.  Louise has provided us with an Excel dataset (Kickstarter) which we (analysts) can use to provide Louise meaningful insights, trends and visualizations of the data which will help Louise develop future successful campaigns.  For the current time, we are providing data or outcomes and visualizations of how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals, which were successful, and which were not. We must also provide Louise a written summery and access to the data findings to help her in future campaign decisions.
### Purpose
We'll be performing data analysis on several thousand crowdfunding projects to uncover any hidden trends to help Louise in decision making. Also, the purpose of the exercise is for us analysts to learn an array of data calculations, presentations and visualizations within Excel that can answer Louise’s questions.  We can also learn to expand on these tools to answer other questions (some simple and some complex) that may be useful for this project and others. 
## Analysis and Challenges
1.	We are providing information on theater outcomes (those successful, failed, and canceled) based on launch dates by month and a pivot chart visual.  A pivot table is developed to show the numbers of successes, failures and cancelations for theaters by month.  A line chartvisual representing this data is provided as follows:

2.  We are providing information on plays outcomes (those successful, failed, and canceled) based on goals and a line chart visual.  The data is calculated and presented in a tabular chart.  The chart provides 12 breakouts of goal ranges for example "<1000", "1000 to 4999", etc.  For each range a countifs function is used to calculate the number plays by successes, failures and cancelations.  Totals of these numbers are summed and percentages are calculated for on each category by range as well.  The results are presented in a line chart as follows:

3.	Lastly, we are providing a written analysis which explains the the analysis completed and presents the outcomes in a visual format so that Louise can utilize it to make future campaign decisions. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The analysis showed the highest number of successful theatrical productions occurred in the May months and these successes significantly outnumbered the failures in this month.  The fewest successes were in December months and were roughly the same as the number of failures which indicates close to a 50/50 chance of success in this month.  Also October shows the highest number of failures with successes only having a slightly higher outcome.  Cancelations appear not to be impacted by month of launch.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Investing in plays at the $45,000 range and above is very risky - this data point shows the least liklihood for success.  There appears to be an inverse relationship of successes to failures.  When successes are high failures are low and vice versa.  Perhaps there is an unrecognized data point to consider like plays advertising dollars spent.  The highest percentage of successes for plays is within the ranges a) less than $1000 range and b) ranges $35000 to $39999 and $40000 to $45000.  There were no cancellations of plays.    
### Challenges and Difficulties
I forget to add plays as a filter within the countifs function.  I overlooked this and it took me a bit to realize what I had done wrong, but once I entered the right formula including plays, it fell into place.  I also realized the countifs and other statements will provide data on “all” data even if filters are in place within the main kickstarter data.  You must either use a filter in the countifs function or you could filter the data in kickstarter and then copy the filtered results into another sheet and then use countifs on this data in the new sheet.  There are multiple ways to get to it and you should use the most efficient process.
## Results
***-	What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?*** The best time to initiate a theatrical campaign is in May and the worst chances for success are in December most notably and October also shows a high potential for failures.  Cancelled productions seem to show no change month to month and must happen due to other factors.

***-	What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?*** Starting a campaign for plays with a goal of $45000 or greater is too risky.  A better bet are a) those less than $1000 and b) then those with a goal range of $35000 to $45000.  But why is there a dip in successes in the range $25000 to $30000?  We might pursue another data point to help answer this question.    

***-	What are some limitations of this dataset?*** The success or failure of a play could be based on many other factors like the subject matter likability or advertising dollars spent by play, who the actors are, etc.  Can this data be collected?  Analysis could get quite complex as you add more criteria and all of these criteria may not be easily measured.  

***-	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?***  We could do an analysis of plays basede on percent funded.  We could do an analysis on plays like Fever which was very close to being funded.  Fever was 86% funded.  We could filer the data for only those plays with a percent funded of 80% to 99% and see when this subset of plays were launched and what goals were set etc.  You can also filter out just US plays or other countries.  I might like to see a bar chart based on percent funded by country – where is best to produce a play?
